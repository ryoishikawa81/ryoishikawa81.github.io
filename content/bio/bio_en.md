### Three-Dimensional Atom-by-Atom Imaging by STEM Depth Sectioning

Following the establishments of aberration-correction optics in electron microscopy, the spatial resolution is extensively improved and now in the regime of deep sub-angstrom (40.5 pm, 2018). However, such high spatial resolution is only valid in the lateral two-dimensions and the remaining depth resolution along the axial direction is still no better than 5 – 10 nm in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). To push the boundary of the STEM capability into three-dimensions, we are developing ‘large-angle illumination’ STEM that could improve the depth resolution.

### High Spatiotemporal STEM Imaging toward Atomic Dynamics
 
Most of research in atomic-resolution STEM imaging is focused on the static atomic structure analysis, owing to the poor temporal resolution in STEM. However, it is also important to understand dynamics at atomic dimension. To realize atomic-resolution dynamic STEM imaging, we are developing a new scanning system, where the temporal resolution should be better than TV rate (<40 ms/frame) with sub-anstrome spatial resolution.
