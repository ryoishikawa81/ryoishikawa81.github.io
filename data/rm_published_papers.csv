 In the scanning transmission electron microscope, both phase imaging of beam-sensitive materials and characterization of a material’s functional properties using in situ experiments are becoming more widely available. As the practicable scan speed of 4D-STEM detectors improves, so too does the temporal resolution achievable for both differential phase contrast (DPC) and ptychography. However, the read-out burden of pixelated detectors, and the size of the gigabyte to terabyte sized data sets, remain a challenge for both temporal resolution and their practical adoption. In this work, we combine ultra-fast scan coils and detector signal digitization to show that a high-fidelity DPC phase reconstruction can be achieved from an annular segmented detector. Unlike conventional analog data phase reconstructions from digitized DPC-segment images yield reliable data, even at the fastest scan speeds. Finally, dose fractionation by fast scanning and multi-framing allows for postprocess binning of frame streams to balance signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for low-dose phase imaging for in situ experiments.",null,"Oxford University Press (OUP)",2024-09-13,null,"Microscopy and Microanalysis",null,null,null,null,null,true,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1093/mam/ozae082,1431-9276,1435-8115,https://academic.oup.com/mam/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae082/59107381/ozae082.pdf,null,false,disclosed

Atomic‐resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization requires precise tilting of the specimen to a high symmetric zone axis, which is usually processed in reciprocal space by following the diffraction patterns. However, for small‐sized nanocrystalline materials, their diffraction patterns are often too faint to guide the tilting process. Here, a simple and effective tilting method is developed based on the diffraction contrast change of the shadow image in the Ronchigram. The misorientation angle of the specimen can be calculated and tilted to the zone axis based on the position of the shadow image with lowest intensity. This method requires no prior knowledge of the sample and the maximum misorientation angle that can be corrected is &gt;±6.9° with sub‐mrad accuracy. It operates in real space, without recording the diffraction patterns of the specimens, making it particularly effective for nanocrystalline materials. Combined with the scripting to control the microscope, the sample can be automatically tilted to the zone axis under low dose conditions (&lt;0.17 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), facilitating the imaging of beam sensitive materials such as zeolites or metal‐organic frameworks.

However, the application of POMs as ligands has been confined predominantly to monometallic nanoclusters.

 Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) enables direct determination of atomic arrangements in materials and devices. However, materials such as battery components are weak for electron beam irradiation, and low electron doses are required to prevent beam-induced damages. Noise removal is thus essential for precise structural analysis of electron-beam-sensitive materials at atomic resolution. Total square variation (TSV) regularization is an algorithm that exhibits high noise removal performance. However, the use of the TSV regularization term leads to significant image blurring and intensity reduction. To address these problems, we here propose a new approach adopting L2 norm regularization based on higher-order total variation. An atomic-resolution STEM image can be approximated as a set of smooth curves represented by quadratic functions. Since the third-degree derivative of any quadratic function is 0, total third-degree variation (TTDV) is suitable for a regularization term. The application of TTDV for denoising the atomic-resolution STEM image of CaF2 observed along the [001] zone axis is shown, where we can clearly see the Ca and F atomic columns without compromising image quality.",null,"Oxford University Press (OUP)",2024-07-02,null,Microscopy,null,null,null,null,null,true,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1093/jmicro/dfae031,2050-5698,2050-5701,https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jmicro/dfae031/58498875/dfae031.pdf,null,false,disclosed

 One of the major innovations awaiting in electron microscopy is full three-dimensional imaging at atomic resolution. Despite the success of aberration correction to deep sub-ångström lateral resolution, spatial resolution in depth is still far from atomic resolution. In scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), this poor depth resolution is due to the limitation of the illumination angle. To overcome this physical limitation, it is essential to implement a next-generation aberration corrector in STEM that can significantly improve the depth resolution. This review discusses the capability of depth sectioning for three-dimensional imaging combined with large-angle illumination STEM. Furthermore, the statistical analysis approach remarkably improves the depth resolution, making it possible to achieve three-dimensional atomic resolution imaging at oxide surfaces. We will also discuss the future prospects of three-dimensional imaging at atomic resolution by STEM depth sectioning.",null,"IOP Publishing",2024-07-01,null,"Chinese Physics B",33,8,086101,086101,null,true,false,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1088/1674-1056/ad4ff9,1674-1056,2058-3834,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-1056/ad4ff9,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-1056/ad4ff9/pdf,false,disclosed

Owing to their remarkable properties, gold nanoparticles are applied in diverse fields, including catalysis, electronics, energy conversion and sensors. However, for catalytic applications of colloidal gold nanoparticles, the trade-off between their reactivity and stability is a significant concern. Here we report a universal approach for preparing stable and reactive colloidal small (~3 nm) gold nanoparticles by using multi-dentate polyoxometalates as protecting agents in non-polar solvents. These nanoparticles exhibit exceptional stability even under conditions of high concentration, long-term storage, heating and addition of bases. Moreover, they display excellent catalytic performance in various oxidation reactions of organic substrates using molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant. Our findings highlight the ability of inorganic multi-dentate ligands with structural stability and robust steric and electronic effects to confer stability and reactivity upon gold nanoparticles.

 Atomic-resolution electron microscopy imaging of solid-state material is a powerful method for structural analysis. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is one of the actively used techniques to directly observe atoms in materials. However, some materials are easily damaged by the electron beam irradiation, and only noisy images are available when we decrease the electron dose to avoid beam damages. Therefore, a denoising process is necessary for precise structural analysis in low-dose STEM. In this study, we propose total variation (TV) denoising algorithm to remove quantum noise in an STEM image. We defined an entropy of STEM image that corresponds to the image contrast to determine a hyperparameter and we found that there is a hyperparameter that maximizes the entropy. We acquired atomic-resolution STEM image of CaF2 viewed along the [001] direction and executed TV denoising. The atomic columns of Ca and F are clearly visualized by the TV denoising, and atomic positions of Ca and F are determined with the error of ±1 pm and ±4 pm, respectively.",null,"Oxford University Press (OUP)",2022-06-17,null,Microscopy,71,5,302,310,eng,true,null,scientific_journal,true,false,10.1093/jmicro/dfac032,2050-5698,2050-5701,https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jmicro/dfac032/44512771/dfac032.pdf,https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article-pdf/71/5/302/46350290/dfac032.pdf,false,disclosed

 Although the possibility of locating single atom in three dimensions using the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has been discussed with the advent of aberration correction technology, it is still a big challenge. In this report we have developed deconvolution routines based on maximum entropy method (MEM) and Richardson–Lucy algorithm (RLA), which are applicable to the STEM-annular dark-field (ADF) though-focus images to improve the depth resolution. The new three-dimensional (3D) deconvolution routines require a limited defocus-range of STEM-ADF images that covers a whole sample and some vacuum regions. Since the STEM-ADF probe is infinitely elongated along the optical axis, a 3D convolution is performed with a two-dimensional (2D) convolution over xy-plane using the 2D fast Fourier transform in reciprocal space, and a one-dimensional convolution along the z-direction in real space.


 Using our new deconvolution routines, we have processed simulated focal series of STEM-ADF images for single Ce dopants embedded in wurtzite-type AlN. Applying the MEM, the Ce peaks are clearly localized along the depth, and the peak width is reduced down to almost one half. We also applied the new deconvolution routines to experimental focal series of STEM-ADF images of a monolayer graphene. The RLA gives smooth and high-P/B ratio scattering distribution, and the graphene layer can be easily detected. Using our deconvolution algorithms, we can determine the depth locations of the heavy dopants and the graphene layer within the precision of 0.1 and 0.2 nm, respectively. Thus, the deconvolution must be extremely useful for the optical sectioning with 3D STEM-ADF images.",null,"Oxford University Press ({OUP})",2020-10,null,Microscopy,70,2,241,249,null,true,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1093/jmicro/dfaa056,2050-5698,2050-5701,http://academic.oup.com/jmicro/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jmicro/dfaa056/33876754/dfaa056.pdf,http://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article-pdf/70/2/241/36683262/dfaa056.pdf,false,disclosed

We elucidate that the delithiated regions have extensive amounts of irreversible defects such as oxygen-release and Mn/Li cation-mixing.

Although LLTO shows a significantly high Li-ion conductivity of 2.2 × 10-3 S cm-1 in the bulk, the Li-ion conductivity at the grain boundary is largely reduced to 4.2 × 10-5 S cm-1, which prevents the practical application of solid-state Li-ion electrolytes. To solve this problem, the origin of such a low Li-ion conductivity at the grain boundary should be clarified. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the Li-ion conductivity and the geometric structure of the grain boundary in the (Li0.33La0.56)TiO3 polycrystal by using electrochemical strain microscopy in atomic force microscopy combined with electron backscatter diffraction in scanning electron microscopy. The experimental data suggest that the Li-ion conductivity is significantly reduced at the random grain boundaries but not at the coincidence-site-lattice (CSL) grain boundaries. Such a small reduction of the Li-ion conductivity at the CSL grain boundaries may originate from the smaller increment of the activation energy, owing to less composition deviations and less structural distortions at the CSL grain boundaries.

A curve fitting is the most important process in the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectra to evaluate the ionic conductivity of materials. To analyze the impedance spectra, a gradient method such as steepest descent has been used so far. However, the parameter solution by using the gradient method is often trapped into local minima, and the curve fitting strongly depends on the initial parameters. In this study, to avoid the local minima issue, we propose a random walk Metropolis Hastings algorithm to analyze impedance spectra, where we can provide a unique solution of the impedance spectra. As an example, we measured the solid-state oxide electrolyte of (La0.62Li0.15)TiO3, (La0.53Li0.40)TiO3 and (La0.31Li0.07)NbO3 polycrystal and we uniquely identify the respective lithium ion conductivity at the bulk and the grain boundary by using the random walk Metropolis Hastings algorithm.

DPC-STEM at atomic resolutions measures how a sub-angstrom electron probe passing through a material is affected by the atomic electric field, the field between the nucleus and the surrounding electrons.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Studies on dislocations in prototypic binary and ternary oxides (here TiO2 and SrTiO3) using modern TEM and scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, combined with classical etch pits methods, are reviewed. Our review focuses on the important role of dislocations in the insulator-to-metal transition and for redox processes, which can be preferentially induced along dislocations using chemical and electrical gradients. It is surprising that, independently of the growth techniques, the density of dislocations in the surface layers of both prototypical oxides is high (109/cm2 for epipolished surfaces and up to 1012/cm2 for the rough surface). The TEM and locally-conducting atomic force microscopy (LCAFM) measurements show that the dislocations create a network with the character of a hierarchical tree. The distribution of the dislocations in the plane of the surface is, in principle, inhomogeneous, namely a strong tendency for the bundling and creation of arrays or bands in the crystallographic <100> and <110> directions can be observed. The analysis of the core of dislocations using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques (such as EDX with atomic resolution, electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)) shows unequivocally that the core of dislocations possesses a different crystallographic structure, electronic structure and chemical composition relative to the matrix. Because the Burgers vector of dislocations is per se invariant, the network of dislocations (with additional d1 electrons) causes an electrical short-circuit of the matrix. This behavior is confirmed by LCAFM measurements for the stoichiometric crystals, moreover a similar dominant role of dislocations in channeling of the current after thermal reduction of the crystals or during resistive switching can be observed. In our opinion, the easy transformation of the chemical composition of the surface layers of both model oxides should be associated with the high concentration of extended defects in this region. Another important insight for the analysis of the physical properties in real oxide crystals (matrix + dislocations) comes from the studies of the nucleation of dislocations via in situ STEM indentation, namely that the dislocations can be simply nucleated under mechanical stimulus and can be easily moved at room temperature.",null,"MDPI} {AG",2018-06,null,Crystals,8,6,241,null,null,true,false,null,null,null,10.3390/cryst8060241,null,2073-4352,http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5801-0971,null,false,disclosed

Annular bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy is a good experimental method for investigating such phenomena due to its ability to image light and heavy atoms simultaneously. To map atomic positions at the required accuracy precise angular alignment of the sample with the microscope optical axis is necessary, since misalignment (tilt) of the specimen contributes to errors in position measurements of lighter elements in annular bright-field imaging. In this paper it is shown that it is possible to detect tilt with the aid of images recorded using a central bright-field detector placed within the inner radius of the annular bright-field detector. For a probe focus near the middle of the specimen the central bright-field image becomes especially sensitive to tilt and we demonstrate experimentally that misalignment can be detected with a precision of less than a milliradian, as we also confirm in simulation. Coma in the probe, an aberration that can be misidentified as tilt of the specimen, is also investigated and it is shown how the effects of coma and tilt can be differentiated.

It was found that two major phases coexist in the alloy, which are of 5:19-2H type and 5:19-3R type superstructures that are constructed by the common structural blocks but with different stacking sequences. A high density of stacking faults were often observed, most of which were of inter-block-layer type that does not change the intra-block structure but simply alters local stacking sequence of the blocks. As a minor phase in the alloy, we identified a novel polytype structure represented as 5: 19-12R, whose long-period block-stacking sequence is described as ABCA'CABC'BCAB'.

The electron-per-atom ratios (e/a) of the quasicrystals were determined quantitatively for the first time from the Compton profiles. The radii of the Fermi spheres were evaluated from the values of e/a on the basis of the free-electron model. Comparisons between the radius of the Fermi spheres and the size of the quasi-Brillouin zones show that the icosahedral quasicrystals meet the empirical matching condition, while the decagonal quasicrystal does not do this so well. This implies that the Hume-Rothery mechanism works for the formation of the pseudogap near the Fermi level in the icosahedral quasicrystals, although it operates only slightly in the decagonal quasicrystal.","{IOP} Publishing","IOP PUBLISHING LTD",2006-08,"J.
